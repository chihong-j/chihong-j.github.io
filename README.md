At the first time when you open the page, everytime when you scroll the page down, the words and the pictures you are browsing will pop up.
This is a RWD website, including all the pictures added by myself are img-fluid. So it also fits mobile web browser.

And I am going to describe all the sections in the page respectively.

Home

There are two designs for the home-section popping up alternately.

About:

There is a number, it counts from 0 to 382 to show my IG followers.
There is a button, you can click it to my instagram page.

Resume:

I get these 6 div blocks to be the same size.
Below this section is a button, you can download my document through it. 

My code:

I open three additional html files. All these pages have the same framework as the index page.(including footer)
The special part is that I use <pre></pre> syntax to show my code completely.(It keeps all the break<br> and indentation<tab>)

Skills:

There are some bars to show percentage.

Projects:

There are 4 pdf files. You can get them by clicking each of the title.

Experience:

I open three additional html files. Alle these pages are articles like journals or blogs. And all these pages have the same framework as the index page.(including footer)
The cover pictures of theses three pages are pictures with translucent black.
There are carousel slides(from bootstrap) inside the pages. Each of them can show 3 pictures dynamically. 
And there are some stuff making these pages just like blogs or journals. Such as tags, catagories, description, and link of other articles.

Contact:

There are 4 icons, two are links of other websites, one can let you call me, and the other can mail me.
Below this section is a block that you can send message to me. And I add a NOTE button with a additional modal(from bootstrap) that will pop up when you click it.
And below the block is a line(from bootstrap) that you can input any range.

footer:

All the things in the footer are links connected to other sections and also my fb and IG.
